SELECT WHERE
SELECT and WHERE are the most fundamental SQL statements and you will find yourself using them often!
The WHERE statement allows us to specify conditions on columns for the rows to be returned.

Basic syntax example:
SELECT column1, dolumn2
FROM table
WHERE conditions;

The WHERE clause appears immediately after the FROM clause of the SELECT statement.
The conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement.
PostgreSQL provides a variety of standard operators to construct the conditions.

Comparison Operators
Compare a column value to something.
Is the price greater then $3.00?
Is the pet's name equal to "Sam"?

SELECT * FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99;
SELECT * FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99
AND rating = 'R';
SELECT title FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99
AND rating = 'R';
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99
AND rating = 'R';
or
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99
AND rating = 'R';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film
WHERE rating = 'R' OR rating = 'PG-13';
SELECT * FROM film
WHERE rating != 'R';
