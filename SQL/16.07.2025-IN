IN

In certain cases you want to check for multiple possible value options, for example, if a user's name shows up IN a list of known names.
We can use the IN operator to create a condition that checks to see if a value in included in a list of multiple options. 

The general syntax is:
value IN (option1,option2,...option_n)

Example query:
SELECT color FROM table
WHERE color IN ('red','blue')
SELECT color FROM table
WHERE color NOT IN ('red','blue','green')
