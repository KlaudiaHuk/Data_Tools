Create Formulas Using Functions

=C1+C2+C3+C4
=C1+D1+E1+F1

Function:
AutoSum 
=SUM(C1:C4) /=SUMA(C1:C4)

Average:
=AVERAGE(C1:C4) / =PROMEDIO(C1:C4)

High:
=MAX(C1:C4)

Functions -> fx -> Insert Function -> All Functions
Choose SUM -> Function Arguments -> Number 1 (mark your cells) Number 2 (maybe you need to add another ones) Number 3, etc.
