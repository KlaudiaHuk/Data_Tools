Installing R:
http://cran.r-project.org/ -> Download R for Windows -> base -> Download R-4.5.0 for Windows

Open and run the file you just downloaded R 
There is no need to change the default installation

Installing Rtools:
http://cran.r-project.org/ -> Dowload R for Windows -> Rtools -> Rtools4.5 -> Rtools45 or 64-bit ARM Rtools45 (I installed Rtools45)

Open and run the file you just downloaded Rtools 
Again, there is no need to change the defaults

Installing RStudio:
course says http://www.rstudio.com/ (in reality its going to be posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) -> DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP FOR WINDOWS -> Download the installer for Windows

Open and run the file you just downloaded RStudio
You don't have to change any of the defaults for the installation

Installing devtools:
Open Rstudio, in the Files/Plots/Packages/Help panel, select Packages and then click on Install

Type devtools under Packages, make sure you spell the name of the package correctly. Then, click on Install

Alternatively, you can run the following command in the console (which I did:

install.packages("devtools") ->CRAN 

Some files for me were not downloaded. What I did - R console ->chooseCRANmirror() ->choose another CRAN -> install.packages(c("name of the file"))

Again in the R console -> library(devtools) -> install_github("jennybc/gapminder")
